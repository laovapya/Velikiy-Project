# Technical specifications

## Name. Basic 3D Editor

## Description

Our application is used to build simple 3D environments. 
The user is able to create primitive 3D objects, such as cubes, spheres and cylinders to then apply transformative operations on them: moving, rotating and scaling, constructing various structures this way.

## Functional requirements

the user must be able to:

1) create primitive 3D objects:

cubes

spheres

cylinders

3) apply transformative operations on them

moving

rotating

scaling

## User Interface

The UI includes the following components:

    1) Scene 
Here, the created objects and changes applied to them are displayed in real time.  

    2) Shape choice menu 
A list of icons representing basic 3D shapes. Clicking on one creates a new object. 

    3)  Collection
A list of names of all created objects. It is used to select an object for transformations. 

    4) Transformations menu
Used to select and apply the transformations (moving, rotating, scaling) and their axes. It is possible to use multiple at once. Has a button to delete an object. 

## Technologies and Frameworks
  1) ImGui for UI
  2) API Integration: OpenGL for 3D objects rendering

## Development Tools
  1) VS code: integrated development environment
  2) Git: version control system
  3) CMake: build system
