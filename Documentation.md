# Technical specifications

## Name. Basic 3D Editor

## Description

Our application is used to build simple 3D environments. 
The user is able to create primitive 3D objects, such as cubes, spheres and cylinders to then apply transformative operations on them: moving, rotating and scaling, constructing various structures this way.

## Functional requirements

the user must be able to:

1) create primitive 3D objects:
  a. cubes
  b. spheres
  c. cylinders

3) apply transformative operations on them
moving
